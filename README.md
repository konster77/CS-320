Ensuring that my code, program, or software is functional and secure requires careful testing and validation throughout development. I prioritize creating unit tests early in the process to detect potential issues before they can become larger problems. I also pay attention to secure coding practices, such as input validation and maintaining data integrity, to protect against vulnerabilities. Automation plays an important role in efficiently checking functionality without the need for extensive manual testing.

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program involves fully understanding the requirements and thinking from the user's perspective. I start by carefully reviewing all provided specifications, and if necessary, breaking down each requirement into smaller, actionable development tasks. Throughout the design and implementation stages, I continually check that the functionality aligns with what the user expects, adjusting features to meet usability and functional goals.

When I approach designing software, I focus on modularity, simplicity, and scalability. I prefer designing small, single-responsibility components that are easy to understand, test, and maintain. I often start by planning the program structure visually or in pseudocode before moving to code. This structured approach helps me build flexible, reliable programs that meet project requirements while remaining adaptable for future improvements or expansions.
